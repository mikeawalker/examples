I keep examples of stuff in here for further reference 


## DMTCP 

"Distributed Multithreadded Checkpointer" from https://github.com/dmtcp/dmtcp. This tool was developed in academia and research circles to checkpoint massive distributed weather models so if they die you dont lose days of compute time. I use it for save/restore of applications running in docker containers. 

Basic example of using DMTCP and issuing a checkpoint in a docker container. 

I use this for checkpointing my containerized applications.
